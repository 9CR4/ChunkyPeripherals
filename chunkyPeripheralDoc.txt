getShape()
   returns a string descripting the current shape.



setShapeCircle(int radius)
   sets the shape to a circle of the defined radius centered on the peripheral 
  Arguments:
     radius: radius of the circle, has to be positive. Non-integer values will be rounded up to the next integer



setShapeSquare(int sideLength)
   sets the shape to a square of the defined size centered on the peripheral. 
  Arguments:
     sideLength: length of the side of the square. has to be positive. Non-integer values will be rounded up to the next integer. If odd will be rounded up to the next even number.




setShapeRectangle(int sideLength)
   equivalent to setShapeSquare(int sideLength)




setShapeRectangle(int sideXLength, int sideZLength)
   sets the shape to a rectangle of the defined size centered on the peripheral. All arguments have to be positive. Non-integer values will be rounded up to the next integer. If odd will be rounded up to the next even number 
  Arguments:
     sideXLength: length of the side aligned to the X axis (west-east)
     sideYLength: length of the side aligned to the Z axis (north-south)


setShapeRectangle(int north, int east, int south, int west)
   sets the shape to a rectangle of the defined size. The parameters define the distances of the sides from the peripheral. All arguments have to be positive. Non-integer values will be rounded up to the next integer.
    - north: direction of the decreasing z
    - east: direction of the increasing x
    - south: direction of the increasing z
    - west: direction of the decreasing x 
   Also, the south direction is indicated by the face with the red thing 
  Arguments:
     north: distance of the north side.
     east: distance of the east side.
     south: distance of the south side.
     west: distance of the west side.



getChunksNumber()
   returns the number of chunks the peripheral is keeping loaded.
 
 
 
getChunksList()
   returns a list of the chunks the peripheral is keeping loaded.
 


disable()
   disables the peripheral, it wont keep loaded any chunk. To re-enable it you have to set a new shape



help(command_name, arg1type, arg2type, ...)
   returns the documentation of the methods. 
  Arguments:
     command_name: string representing the name of the command. argNtype: string representing the type of the argument N.
